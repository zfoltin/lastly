# lastly
Last.fm sample app

_Work in progress_

TODO:
- unit and UI tests (for examples see the https://github.com/zfoltin/twittererer repo for now)
- introduce Dagger 2 dependency injection (again in twitterere repo for now)
- tidy up the artist detail screen (create styles for common text styles, move common sizes to values (8dp, 16dp, 32dp, 20sp...), make html look html in the artist bio text, improve the design somewhat, etc.
- introduce Android Architecture Components ViewModels to handle orientation change gracefully in the app
