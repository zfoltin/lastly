# Lastly

Coding test using Last.fm

_Work in progress_

### API

[Get artist info](https://www.last.fm/api/show/artist.getInfo)

[Sample search](https://ws.audioscrobbler.com/2.0/?method=artist.getinfo&artist=Cher&api_key=5abe1e36c731df9fe52f884ce99455ec&format=json)

Unfortunately images are [no more](https://getsatisfaction.com/lastfm/topics/api-announcement-dac8oefw5vrxq) ðŸ˜ž

### TODO

- [ ] Unit and UI tests (for examples see the https://github.com/zfoltin/twittererer repo for now)
- [ ] Introduce dependency injection (again, see an example in the [twitterere](https://github.com/zfoltin/twittererer) repo for now)
- [ ] Tidy up the artist detail screen
- [ ] Create styles for common text styles
- [ ] Move common sizes to dimens.xml (8dp, 16dp, 32dp, 20sp...)
- [ ] Make HTML look HTML in the artist bio text
- [x] Improve the UX by using shared element activity transition for the artist image and name
- [ ] Use Android Architecture Components - ViewModels, Live Data, Navigation...
- [ ] Upgrade to AndroidX and Material Components
